## Code Examples

### Anime.js v4 Basic Animation
```javascript
import { animate, stagger, createTimeline } from 'animejs';

// Simple animation
animate('.element', {
  translateX: { from: 0, to: 250 },
  rotate: { from: 0, to: 180 },
  duration: 800,
  ease: 'outElastic'
});    

### Loading Spinner
```javascript
function createMatrixSpinner() {
  const spinner = document.createElement('div');
  spinner.className = 'matrix-spinner';
  
  const chars = '01ã‚¢ã‚¤ã‚¦ã‚¨ã‚ªã‚«ã‚­ã‚¯ã‚±ã‚³'.split('');
  const radius = 50;
  
  chars.forEach((char, i) => {
    const span = document.createElement('span');
    span.textContent = char;
    span.className = 'spinner-char';
    
    const angle = (i / chars.length) * Math.PI * 2;
    span.style.left = `${50 + radius * Math.cos(angle)}%`;
    span.style.top = `${50 + radius * Math.sin(angle)}%`;
    
    spinner.appendChild(span);
  });
  
  document.body.appendChild(spinner);
  
  // Animate
  animate('.spinner-char', {
    opacity: { from: 0, to: 1 },
    scale: { from: 0, to: 1 },
    translateY: { from: -10, to: 10 },
    delay: stagger(50, { from: 'center' }),
    duration: 800,
    loop: true,
    alternate: true
  });
}
```
