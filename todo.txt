Go to live site and get the matrix rain and rotating grid animations, and button animations and all unique stuff back into the react version of the site

make sure mobile is good too

commit things and then fix css so it looks perfect, make sure fonts are all fixed and it all looks professional 

commit these changes, now we will clean up file by file and test the page each time, get rid of unused css and js files 

then deploy 

optional but good to do - update version timetravel with v3.5 latest and add a section for v3.0 and add the index.html into that project


make the projects page better as well (just looks wise, and add an area for an image that is the            │
│   background of the projects tab)
