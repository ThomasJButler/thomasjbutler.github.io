## Technical Implementation

### Current Routing Structure
```tsx
// App.tsx
<BrowserRouter basename="/ThomasJButler">
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
    <Route path="/about" element={<AboutPage />} />
    <Route path="/projects" element={<ProjectsPage />} />
    <Route path="/contact" element={<ContactPage />} />
    <Route path="/blog" element={<BlogPage />} />
    <Route path="/blog/:slug" element={<BlogReader />} />
    <Route path="/skills" element={<SkillsPage />} /> // Pending
    <Route path="/services" element={<ServicesPage />} /> // Pending
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```

### Animation Hooks Implemented
```typescript
// Custom hooks created
useMatrixAnimation    // Anime.js integration
useScrollReveal      // Scroll-based reveals
useScrollDetection   // Hide/show on scroll
useCardAnimations    // Card hover effects
useScrollAnimation   // General scroll animations
```

### Design System Integration
```css
/* CSS Variables now in use */
--matrix-green: #00FF00;
--duration-fast: 150ms;
--duration-base: 300ms;
--duration-slow: 500ms;
--space-sm: 0.5rem;
--space-md: 1rem;
--space-lg: 1.5rem;
--space-xl: 2rem;
```

## Architectural Decisions

### Why Keep Hybrid Architecture?
- Zero downtime during migration
- A/B testing capabilities
- SEO preservation during transition
- Gradual user migration

### Animation Strategy
- **Anime.js v4** for complex animations
- **CSS transitions** for micro-interactions
- **RequestAnimationFrame** for performance
- **Intersection Observer** for lazy loading

### Performance Targets
- Lighthouse score: 95+ (currently 92)
- First Contentful Paint: <1.5s
- Time to Interactive: <3.5s
- Bundle size: <200KB gzipped

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Incremental migration** - No breaking changes
2. **CSS Modules** - Perfect scoping, no conflicts
3. **TypeScript** - Caught many bugs early
4. **Unified state** - Solved animation conflicts
5. **Custom hooks** - Great reusability

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Cube rotation conflicts** - Solved with unified state
2. **Performance on mobile** - GPU acceleration helped
3. **Blog system integration** - Markdown loader success
4. **Animation timing** - Standardized durations

### Best Practices Established
- Always use CSS variables for theming
- Implement accessibility from the start
- Test on real devices, not just browser
- Document as you build
- Keep animations under 500ms
