# The Dehumanisation of Development: How We Lost Our Craft

## When Coding Became Factory Work

This one's been bothering me for a while.

Remember when code was a craft? When developers were artisans? When every line had intention, every function had soul?

I do. It wasn't that long ago. But now? We've become code factories. And AI? It's making it worse, not better.

## The Assembly Line Mentality

### Before: Craftsperson

When I started coding here in Liverpool, it was different:
- You understood the whole system (had to, no Stack Overflow back then)
- Made thoughtful decisions (because every byte mattered)
- Took pride in elegance (beautiful code was the goal)
- Signed your work (with pride, not git blame shame)

### Now: Factory Worker

Look at us now:
- Copy-paste from Stack Overflow
- Generate with AI (prompt, generate, ship)
- Ship and forget (on to the next ticket)
- Anonymous contributions (just another cog)

It's soul-destroying.

## The AI Acceleration

Here's the kicker. AI promised to eliminate the tedious bits so we could focus on the craft. But what's actually happening?

AI's eliminating the craft itself:
- Why understand when AI explains? (but does it really?)
- Why design when AI generates? (generic solutions for unique problems)
- Why learn when AI knows? (until it doesn't and you're stuck)

I've watched junior devs become prompt engineers instead of software engineers. That's not progress, that's regression.

## What We're Losing

### Understanding
Using without knowing how it works. Like driving a car without knowing what an engine is. Fine until it breaks down on the M62 in the rain.

### Ownership
Code without connection. It's not "my code" anymore, it's "the code AI generated that I tweaked a bit."

### Pride
Shipping without satisfaction. Remember that feeling when your code worked perfectly? When was the last time you felt that with generated code?

### Growth
Producing without learning. You can ship 10x more code but understand 10x less. That's not a win.

## The Hidden Cost

Let me tell you what this is really costing us:

### Technical Debt
Generated code we don't understand becomes unmaintainable. I've seen codebases turn into digital landfills. Nobody knows what anything does, but it "works" so nobody touches it.

### Innovation Drought
Can't innovate beyond what AI suggests. We're painting by numbers instead of creating art.

### Skill Atrophy
Use it or lose it, and we're losing it. I've met "senior" devs who can't write a sorting algorithm. That's terrifying.

### Joy Deficit
The satisfaction of craft? Gone. Replaced by the anxiety of not understanding your own codebase.

## The Liverpool Way: Reclaiming Our Humanity

Here's how I'm fighting back:

### AI as Apprentice, Not Master
- I design, AI implements (I'm the architect, it's the builder)
- I decide, AI executes (I'm the chef, it's the sous chef)
- I learn, AI assists (I'm the student, it's the calculator)

### Maintaining Craft
Every Friday, we have "Craft Day":
- Understand what you ship (code review everything, even AI code)
- Own your decisions (your name on the commit, your responsibility)
- Sign your work (with pride, not resignation)
- Take pride (celebrate elegant solutions, not just shipped features)

### Building With Intention
Every line should have purpose. If you can't explain why it's there, it shouldn't be there.
Every function should have thought. Not just "AI said this was good."
Every system should have soul. Your personality in the architecture.

## Real Talk: The Choice We're Making

I was at a Liverpool tech meetup last month, and a young dev asked me: "Why bother learning the fundamentals when AI can do it all?"

I bought him a pint and explained:

### Path 1: Full Automation (The Dark Timeline)
- Humans become obsolete
- Craft disappears completely
- Joy evaporates
- We become button-pushers

We're already seeing this. Developers who are really just AI prompters. That's not development, that's delegation to a robot.

### Path 2: Augmented Craft (The Better Way)
- Humans enhanced, not replaced
- Craft elevated, not eliminated
- Joy amplified, not destroyed
- We become super-developers

This is what I'm fighting for. AI as a power tool, not a replacement.

## Fight for the Craft

We're at a crossroads, and the path we choose now determines the future of our craft.

I refuse to become a prompt engineer. I'm a software developer. I build things. I understand things. I create things.

Yes, I use AI. But I use it like any tool, with intention, understanding, and control. The day I ship code I don't understand is the day I hang up my keyboard.

Easier isn't always better. Microwave meals are easier than cooking, but which would you rather eat every day?

Code is poetry. Don't let it become commodity. Code is craft. Don't let it become factory work. Code is human expression. Don't let it become robotic output.

The best code comes from understanding, not automation. From intention, not convenience. From craft, not speed. AI can make us faster, but only craft makes us better.

The future needs developers who understand. Who think. Who create. Not operators who prompt and ship without comprehension.

Choose craft. Choose understanding. Choose humanity. The code you write today shapes the developer you become tomorrow.
