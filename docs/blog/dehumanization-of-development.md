# The Dehumanization of Development: How We Lost Our Craft

## When Coding Became Factory Work

Remember when code was craft?
When developers were artisans?
When every line had intention?

Now we're code factories, and AI is making it worse.

## The Assembly Line Mentality

### Before: Craftsperson
- Understood the whole system
- Made thoughtful decisions
- Took pride in elegance
- Signed their work

### Now: Factory Worker
- Copy-paste from Stack Overflow
- Generate with AI
- Ship and forget
- Anonymous contributions

## The AI Acceleration

AI promised to eliminate tedium.
Instead, it's eliminating craft:
- Why understand when AI explains?
- Why design when AI generates?
- Why learn when AI knows?

## What We're Losing

### Understanding
Using without knowing how it works

### Ownership
Code without connection

### Pride
Shipping without satisfaction

### Growth
Producing without learning

## The Hidden Cost

### Technical Debt
Generated code we don't understand becomes unmaintainable

### Innovation Drought
Can't innovate beyond what AI suggests

### Skill Atrophy
Use it or lose it - we're losing it

### Joy Deficit
The satisfaction of craft, gone

## Reclaiming Our Humanity

### AI as Apprentice, Not Master
- You design, AI implements
- You decide, AI executes
- You learn, AI assists

### Maintaining Craft
- Understand what you ship
- Own your decisions
- Sign your work
- Take pride

### Building With Intention
Every line should have purpose
Every function should have thought
Every system should have soul

## The Future We Choose

### Path 1: Full Automation
- Humans become obsolete
- Craft disappears
- Joy evaporates

### Path 2: Augmented Craft
- Humans enhanced
- Craft elevated
- Joy amplified

We're at the crossroads now.
