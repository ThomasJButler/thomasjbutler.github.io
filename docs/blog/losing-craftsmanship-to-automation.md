# Losing Craftsmanship to Automation: The Silent Crisis

## The Master and The Machine

A master carpenter knows every tool in their workshop intimately.
Modern developers? We barely know what's in our node_modules.

We've traded mastery for velocity. And I'm watching it happen every day in Liverpool's tech scene.

## The Craftsmanship We Had

Remember when developers were craftspeople?

### Understanding Every Line
I started coding in the 90s. We knew what every line did and why. Not because we were smarter, because we had to. No Stack Overflow, no AI, just you and the compiler.

My first mentor made me write a linked list from scratch. "How else will you understand it?" he said. Seemed excessive at the time. Now I get it.

### Intentional Design
Architecture with thought, not templates. Every decision deliberate:
- Why this pattern?
- Why this structure?
- Why this approach?

We'd spend Friday afternoons at the pub sketching systems on napkins. Those napkin designs? Still running in production 10 years later.

### Pride in Work
We signed our code like artists sign paintings. Comments with our initials. Easter eggs with our names. We owned our work, the good and the bad.

I still remember finding "// TB was here, 2003" in some ancient codebase. That was me. Still proud of that recursive function.

## The Automation Trap

Now look at us.

### Generate Without Understanding
```javascript
// Developer: "AI, create an auth system"
// AI: *generates 500 lines*
// Developer: *copies, pastes, ships*
// Also Developer: "What's a JWT?"
```

Last week, a junior asked me to help debug their authentication. They'd generated the entire thing with AI. When I asked how it worked, they said "I don't know, the AI wrote it."

That's not development. That's cargo cult programming.

### Template Without Thinking
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
npm install every-package-ever
npm run build
# Ship it!
```

Zero decisions made. Zero understanding gained. Just following recipes we don't comprehend.

### Ship Without Pride
Code as commodity, not craft. Nobody cares who wrote it, how it works, or why it exists. Just does it pass the tests? (What tests?)

We've become code factory workers, not craftspeople.

## The Real Cost

When craftsmanship dies:
- **Quality becomes accident**: "It works" doesn't mean "It's good"
- **Innovation becomes impossible**: Can't innovate what you don't understand
- **Joy becomes memory**: Remember when coding was fun?
- **Purpose becomes paycheck**: Clock in, generate code, clock out

The saddest part? New developers don't know what they're missing. They think this is normal.

## What We're Really Losing

### The Debugging Mindset
When you understand your code, debugging is detective work. When you don't, it's playing whack-a-mole in the dark.

### The Improvement Instinct
Craftspeople naturally improve their work. "This could be better" becomes "Let me make it better". But when it's not your code, why bother?

### The Learning Journey
Every line you write teaches you something. Every line you generate teaches you nothing.

## Reclaiming Craft in the Age of AI

Here's how I'm fighting back:

### AI as Tool, Not Replacement
Like a power saw for a carpenter. Speeds up the work, doesn't replace the skill.

Use AI to:
- Handle boilerplate (then customise it)
- Suggest approaches (then choose consciously)
- Speed up typing (not thinking)

Never let AI:
- Make your decisions
- Own your understanding
- Replace your learning

### Maintain Understanding
My rules:
- Never ship what you don't understand
- Never use what you can't explain
- Never generate what you can't debug

If you can't whiteboard it, you don't know it.

### Sign Your Work
Take ownership. Take pride. Take responsibility.

Add your touch:
- Your naming conventions
- Your error handling style
- Your optimisation approach

Make it yours. Because craftsmanship isn't about perfection. It's about intentionality.

## The Liverpool Way

I'm building a different culture here:
- Code reviews where we explain why, not just what
- Fridays where we rebuild things from scratch to understand them
- Mentoring that values understanding over velocity

Small rebellion against the automation empire.

## Choose Craft

Automation should enhance craft, not replace it. AI should be your apprentice, not your master.

The day we stop caring about craftsmanship is the day we stop being developers and become code operators. I refuse to let that happen.

The best code doesn't come from the fastest tools. It comes from understanding. From intention. From pride in your work. AI can make us faster, but only craft makes us better.

The future doesn't need operators who can prompt AI to generate code. It needs developers who understand what they're building and why. Who can debug what breaks. Who can innovate beyond what currently exists.

Choose craft. Choose understanding. The code you write today shapes the developer you become tomorrow.
