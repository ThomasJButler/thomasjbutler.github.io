# Losing Craftsmanship to Automation: The Silent Crisis

## The Master and The Machine

A master craftsperson knows their tools intimately.
Modern developers barely know their dependencies.

We've traded mastery for velocity.

## The Craftsmanship We Had

### Understanding Every Line
Developers who knew what every line did and why

### Intentional Design
Architecture with thought, not templates

### Pride in Work
Signing code like artists sign paintings

## The Automation Trap

### Generate Without Understanding
AI writes, we ship, nobody knows how it works

### Template Without Thinking
Boilerplates and scaffolds, no decisions made

### Ship Without Pride
Code as commodity, not craft

## The Real Cost

When craftsmanship dies:
- Quality becomes accident
- Innovation becomes impossible
- Joy becomes memory
- Purpose becomes paycheck

## Reclaiming Craft in the Age of AI

### AI as Tool, Not Replacement
Like a power tool for a carpenter
Speeds work, doesn't replace skill

### Maintain Understanding
Never ship what you don't understand
Never use what you can't explain

### Sign Your Work
Take ownership
Take pride
Take responsibility

*Automation should enhance craft, not replace it.*
