# Manifesto: Human-First Technology

## We Stand at a Crossroads

Technology can elevate humanity or erase it.
AI can amplify our abilities or atrophy them.

From my desk in Liverpool, watching this unfold, I know which path we need to take.
We choose elevation. We choose amplification.

## Our Principles

### 1. Humans First, Always
Technology serves humanity, not the reverse.
Every feature must enhance human capability.
Every design must respect human nature.

No more "move fast and break things" when the things we're breaking are people.

### 2. Memory Over Amnesia
Systems must remember and evolve.
Context must persist and grow.
Understanding must deepen, not reset.

I'm tired of explaining the same project to AI fifty times. Technology should have better memory than a goldfish.

### 3. Personalisation Over Generalisation
Every person is unique.
Every AI should be too.
Diversity in thought must be preserved.

Your AI should know you prefer tabs. Mine knows I use snake_case. Neither of us is wrong. Both of us deserve tools that understand us.

### 4. Amplification Over Replacement
AI should make us more capable, not less necessary.
Tools should enhance craft, not eliminate it.
Automation should free us for higher work, not leave us without purpose.

I want AI that makes me a better developer, not one that makes developers obsolete.

### 5. Understanding Over Output
Quality over quantity.
Comprehension over generation.
Wisdom over speed.

Ship 100 lines you understand, not 1000 you don't. The bugs you can't fix aren't worth the time you "saved".

### 6. Craft Over Commodity
Code is art, not assembly.
Development is craft, not factory work.
Every line should have intention.

We're craftspeople, not code monkeys. Our work has soul, personality, purpose. Let's keep it that way.

### 7. Sustainable Over Extractive
Respect human limits.
Build for longevity.
Prioritise wellbeing over velocity.

Nobody's best work happens at 3am after their fifth Red Bull. Technology should support sustainable practice, not demand constant availability.

## Our Vision

A future where:
- AI knows you deeply but serves you completely (partner, not master)
- Technology adapts to humans, not vice versa (we're not machines)
- Every developer maintains their unique voice (diversity is strength)
- Craft and creativity flourish alongside automation (both/and, not either/or)
- Humans and AI collaborate as true partners (equals with different strengths)

This isn't sci-fi. I'm building this right now in Liverpool.

## Our Commitment

We will build technology that:
- **Remembers**: Your patterns, preferences, and progress
- **Adapts**: To your style, not forcing you into theirs
- **Enhances**: Your abilities without replacing them
- **Respects**: Your humanity, limits, and needs
- **Empowers**: You to do better work, not just more work

We will resist technology that:
- **Forgets**: Everything the moment you close the tab
- **Demands conformity**: One size fits nobody
- **Replaces**: Human creativity with statistical averages
- **Dehumanises**: Treats developers as code-producing resources
- **Exploits**: Burns people out for marginal gains

## Our Call to Action

Join us in building:
- Context systems that actually bloody remember
- AI that adapts to you (not the other way round)
- Tools that enhance humanity (not exploit it)
- Technology with genuine empathy (not fake cheerfulness)
- A future where humans matter (radical idea, that)

## The Revolution Starts Now

Not with massive funding (though that'd be nice).
Not with corporate backing (they're part of the problem).
But with developers who care.
With builders who believe.
With humans who refuse to be optimised away.

Starting here in Liverpool. Spreading wherever developers still give a damn about craft.

## Your Part

**Build with intention**: Every line should have purpose
**Code with craft**: Take pride in your work
**Design with empathy**: Remember the humans
**Ship with pride**: Sign your work (metaphorically)
**Share with community**: Knowledge wants to be free

Stop accepting:
- Tools that forget you exist
- AI that makes you feel stupid
- Workflows that burn you out
- Technology that dehumanises

Start demanding:
- Better memory
- Real adaptation
- Genuine understanding
- Actual partnership

## The Liverpool Declaration

From this grey city by the Mersey, where The Beatles changed music and the docks changed commerce, we're changing how humans and AI work together.

Not Silicon Valley hype.
Not London finance pressure.
Just honest developers building honest tools for honest work.

We're not just building better technology.
We're building a better relationship between humanity and technology.

One where humans aren't optimised away.
One where craft still matters.
One where technology serves, not enslaves.

## Join Us

This isn't a corporate initiative.
It's a grassroots rebellion.
Developer by developer.
Project by project.
Line by line.

The future isn't determined. It's designed.
And we're the designers.

Time to design something better.
