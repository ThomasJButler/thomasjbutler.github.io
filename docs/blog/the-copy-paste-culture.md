# The Copy-Paste Culture: When Everyone's Code Looks the Same

## The Homogenization of Code

Open 10 React projects on GitHub.
They look identical.
Same structure. Same patterns. Same soul-less efficiency.

We've automated creativity out of coding.

## The Pipeline of Sameness

1. Google the problem
2. Copy from Stack Overflow
3. Or generate with AI
4. Paste and tweak
5. Ship it

No understanding. No personality. No craft.

## The AI Amplification

AI trained on millions of repos
Produces the statistical average
Every output a blend of everything
Nothing unique, everything familiar

## What We're Losing

### Individual Style
Every developer used to have a signature
Now we all write the same AI-averaged code

### Creative Solutions
Why think when you can copy?
Why innovate when you can replicate?

### Deep Understanding
Copying syntax without grasping concepts
Using patterns without knowing why

## The Danger

When everyone codes the same:
- Same vulnerabilities everywhere
- Same limitations accepted
- Same blind spots shared
- Innovation stops

## Breaking Free

### Develop Your Style
Write code that's recognizably yours
Make choices, not defaults
Have opinions, not acceptance

### Understand Before Using
Never paste code you don't understand
Never generate what you can't explain
Never ship what you didn't craft

### Create, Don't Copy
Solve problems from first principles
Build your own patterns
Write your own story

*In a world of copy-paste, originality is rebellion.*
