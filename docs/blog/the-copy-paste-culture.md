# The Copy-Paste Culture: When Everyone's Code Looks the Same

## The Homogenisation of Code

Open 10 React projects on GitHub.
They look identical.
Same structure. Same patterns. Same soulless efficiency.

We've automated creativity out of coding.

## The Pipeline of Sameness

Every day, thousands of developers:
1. Google the problem
2. Copy from Stack Overflow
3. Or generate with AI
4. Paste and tweak
5. Ship it

No understanding. No personality. No craft.

I watched a junior dev last week copy an entire authentication system without knowing what JWT stood for. It worked. But is that really development?

## The AI Amplification

AI trained on millions of repos produces the statistical average.
Every output a blend of everything.
Nothing unique, everything familiar.

It's like asking for a meal and getting beige paste. Nutritionally complete, utterly forgettable.

## What We're Losing

### Individual Style
Every developer used to have a signature. I could tell who wrote code just by looking at it. Sarah always used guard clauses. Mike loved his ternaries. Dave's code was unmistakable (for better or worse).

Now? We all write the same AI-averaged code.

### Creative Solutions
Why think when you can copy?
Why innovate when you can replicate?

I've seen the same solution to the same problem implemented the same way in companies from Liverpool to London. That's not convergent evolution. That's copy-paste culture.

### Deep Understanding
Copying syntax without grasping concepts.
Using patterns without knowing why.

We're creating a generation of developers who can build anything but understand nothing.

## The Danger

When everyone codes the same:
- **Same vulnerabilities everywhere**: One bug, millions affected
- **Same limitations accepted**: "That's just how it's done"
- **Same blind spots shared**: Nobody questions the pattern
- **Innovation stops**: Why try something new?

Remember log4j? One vulnerability, half the internet affected. That's what happens when everyone uses the same code.

## The UK Perspective

British developers have always had our own style:
- Pragmatic over perfect
- Understated but solid
- Dry humour in comments
- Tea breaks in the code flow

But we're losing it to global homogenisation. Our code is becoming as generic as a Starbucks in any city.

## Breaking Free

### Develop Your Style
Write code that's recognisably yours:
- Choose your patterns deliberately
- Make choices, not defaults
- Have opinions, not acceptance

My code uses snake_case. It's readable, it's clear, and it's mine.

### Understand Before Using
Never paste code you don't understand.
Never generate what you can't explain.
Never ship what you didn't craft.

If you can't explain it to a rubber duck, you shouldn't use it.

### Create, Don't Copy
Solve problems from first principles:
- What's the actual problem?
- What's the simplest solution?
- What's the best solution for THIS situation?

Not every nail needs the Stack Overflow hammer.

## My Challenge to You

Next time you reach for Ctrl+V, stop.
Next time AI suggests code, question it.
Next time you see a pattern, improve it.

Write code that's yours. Not because it's better (though it might be), but because it's crafted, understood, and intentional.

## Choose Understanding

In a world of copy-paste, originality is rebellion.

Be a rebel. Write your own code. Understand what you build. Create something unique.

Here's what scares me: we're one generation away from developers who can't build from first principles. Who know patterns but not why they work. Who can assemble code but not create it.

And when the next paradigm shift comes, when the patterns everyone copies become obsolete, who will know how to create new ones? Not the copy-pasters. They'll wait for someone else to solve it first.

Don't be that developer. Be the one who understands. Who creates. Who thinks.
