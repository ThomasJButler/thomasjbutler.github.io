# AI That Codes Like You: The Personalisation Revolution

## Your Code is Your Signature

Right, let's talk about something every developer knows but nobody really addresses - we all have our own coding style:
- How you name variables (snake_case gang, where you at?)
- How you structure functions (early returns or nested ifs?)
- How you handle errors (try/catch everything or let it fail fast?)
- How you write comments (or don't - we've all been there)

It's your coding DNA. And AI? It completely ignores it, doesn't it?

## The Generic Code Problem

AI generates "correct" code that looks wrong (and mate, we've all been there):
```javascript
// AI's generic American style
const fetchUserData = async (userId) => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
        return await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
        throw error;
    }
};

// Your actual style (the proper way, obviously)
const fetch_user_data = async (user_id) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${user_id}`)
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Failed to fetch user ${user_id}`)
  return response.json()
}
```

Both work. Only one feels like home.

## The Reformation Ritual

Right, let me paint you a picture that'll be familiar to any dev worth their salt:
1. AI generates code
2. You spend ages reformatting everything
3. You rename all the variables (because who uses camelCase when snake_case is right there?)
4. You restructure the logic to match how your brain works
5. You fix the style to not look like a robot wrote it

Honestly, why are we putting up with this? It's like having a brilliant assistant who speaks a different dialect - technically correct, but just... off.

## Enter Style DNA

### Teach Once, Apply Forever

Here's what I've been working on - proper game-changer, this:

```markdown
# customcodestyle.md

## My Style (The Thomas Butler Way)
- Snake_case for functions (we're not Java devs)
- No semicolons (ASI works fine, ta)
- Early returns (none of that nested nonsense)
- Minimal try/catch (fail fast, handle at boundaries)
- Descriptive errors (users deserve to know what went wrong)
```

### Provide Real Examples
```javascript
// My actual code - how we do it up north
const process_payment = async (payment_data) => {
  if (!payment_data.amount) return null
  
  const result = await payment_api.charge(payment_data)
  if (!result.success) {
    throw new Error(`Payment failed: ${result.error} - proper gutted`)
  }
  
  return result.transaction_id
}
```

### AI Learns YOUR Style
Now every generation matches:
- Your naming (snake_case, kebab-case, whatever floats your boat)
- Your structure (flat is better than nested, fight me)
- Your patterns (DRY but not obsessively)
- Your preferences (tabs vs spaces? Let's not go there)

## The Technical Implementation

### Style Extraction
```javascript
// Analyse existing codebase (note the 's' in analyse - we're British)
const patterns = {
  naming: detectNamingConvention(codebase),
  structure: detectCodeStructure(codebase),
  formatting: detectFormatting(codebase),
  patterns: detectCommonPatterns(codebase)
}
```

### Style Injection
```javascript
// Apply to all generations - the magic happens here
const generateCode = (request) => {
  const code = ai.generate(request)
  return applyStyle(code, userStyle)
}
```

### Style Evolution
```javascript
// Learn from corrections - it gets better over time
if (userEdited(generatedCode)) {
  updateStyle(findDifferences(generated, edited))
}
```

## Real Impact

### Before (The Dark Times)
- Generate: 30 seconds
- Reformat: 5 minutes (if you're lucky)
- Swearing at screen: 2 minutes
- Total: 7:30 minutes of faff

### After (The Enlightenment)
- Generate: 30 seconds
- Review: 30 seconds
- Get on with actual work: Priceless
- Total: 1 minute, sorted

## The Business Case

Look, I've been doing this for years, and here's what matters:
- **Consistency**: Your entire codebase looks like one person wrote it (because essentially, they did)
- **Speed**: No more reformatting means shipping faster
- **Sanity**: Less cognitive load switching between AI style and your style
- **Team Harmony**: Everyone codes their way, git diffs show what matters

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Personal Profiles
Start with individual developer profiles. I've got mine set up:
- Functions: snake_case
- Variables: descriptive_names_over_brevity
- Comments: Only when the why isn't obvious
- Testing: Jest with proper British spelling in describe blocks

### Phase 2: Team Standards
Merge personal preferences into team standards:
- Agree on the non-negotiables
- Allow flexibility where it doesn't matter
- Stop having those pointless style arguments in PRs

### Phase 3: AI Integration
Train your AI assistant on your patterns:
- Feed it your best code
- Correct it when it goes American on you
- Watch it learn and adapt

## The Revolution Is Personal

This isn't about right or wrong - there's no "correct" way to write code (though if you use tabs over spaces, we need to have a word).

It's about:
- **Ownership**: Your code should feel like yours
- **Efficiency**: Stop wasting time on reformatting
- **Joy**: Actually enjoying the code you work with
- **Pride**: Being proud of every line, even the AI-generated ones

## What's Next

The future of AI coding (as I see it from my desk overlooking the Mersey):
1. **Personal style profiles** - your coding fingerprint
2. **Team style consensus** - because we all need to get along
3. **Project-specific adaptations** - when in Rome and all that
4. **Evolution with your growth** - the AI learns as you level up

## The Bottom Line

Code is personal.
Style is identity.
AI should respect both.

Stop reformatting.
Start personalising.
Make AI code like you.

Because your style isn't wrong.
It's yours.

And if anyone tells you otherwise, send them my way. We'll have a proper chat about it over a pint at the Baltic Fleet.
