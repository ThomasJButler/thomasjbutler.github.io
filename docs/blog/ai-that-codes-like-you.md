# AI That Codes Like You: The Personalisation Revolution

## Your Code is Your Signature

Every developer knows this, but few talk about it. We all have our own coding style:
- How you name variables (snake_case or camelCase?)
- How you structure functions (early returns or nested ifs?)
- How you handle errors (try/catch everything or fail fast?)
- How you write comments (or don't)

It's your coding DNA. And current AI? It completely ignores it.

## The Generic Code Problem

AI generates "correct" code that somehow looks wrong:
```javascript
// AI's generic American style
const fetchUserData = async (userId) => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
        return await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
        throw error;
    }
};

// Your actual style
const fetch_user_data = async (user_id) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${user_id}`)
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error(`Failed to fetch user ${user_id}`)
  return response.json()
}
```

Both work. Only one feels like home.

## The Reformation Ritual

Here's a pattern that will be familiar:
1. AI generates code
2. You spend time reformatting everything
3. You rename all the variables
4. You restructure the logic to match how your brain works
5. You fix the style to not look like a robot wrote it

Why are we accepting this? It's like having a brilliant assistant who speaks a different dialect. Technically correct, but just off.

## Enter Style DNA

### Teach Once, Apply Forever

Here's what I've been working on:

```markdown
# customcodestyle.md

## My Style (The Thomas Butler Way)
- Snake_case for functions
- No semicolons (ASI works fine)
- Early returns (avoid nested logic)
- Minimal try/catch (fail fast, handle at boundaries)
- Descriptive errors (users deserve to know what went wrong)
```

### Provide Real Examples
```javascript
// My actual code
const process_payment = async (payment_data) => {
  if (!payment_data.amount) return null

  const result = await payment_api.charge(payment_data)
  if (!result.success) {
    throw new Error(`Payment failed: ${result.error}`)
  }

  return result.transaction_id
}
```

### AI Learns YOUR Style
Now every generation matches:
- Your naming (snake_case, kebab-case, whatever works for you)
- Your structure (flat is better than nested)
- Your patterns (DRY but not obsessively)
- Your preferences (tabs vs spaces aside)

## The Technical Implementation

### Style Extraction
```javascript
// Analyse existing codebase (note the 's')
const patterns = {
  naming: detectNamingConvention(codebase),
  structure: detectCodeStructure(codebase),
  formatting: detectFormatting(codebase),
  patterns: detectCommonPatterns(codebase)
}
```

### Style Injection
```javascript
// Apply to all generations
const generateCode = (request) => {
  const code = ai.generate(request)
  return applyStyle(code, userStyle)
}
```

### Style Evolution
```javascript
// Learn from corrections
if (userEdited(generatedCode)) {
  updateStyle(findDifferences(generated, edited))
}
```

## Real Impact

### Before
- Generate: 30 seconds
- Reformat: 5 minutes
- Total: 5:30 minutes

### After
- Generate: 30 seconds
- Review: 30 seconds
- Total: 1 minute

## The Business Case

Look, I've been doing this for years, and here's what matters:
- **Consistency**: Your entire codebase looks like one person wrote it
- **Speed**: No more reformatting means shipping faster
- **Sanity**: Less cognitive load switching between AI style and your style
- **Team Harmony**: Everyone codes their way, git diffs show what matters

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Personal Profiles
Start with individual developer profiles. I've got mine set up:
- Functions: snake_case
- Variables: descriptive_names_over_brevity
- Comments: Only when the why isn't obvious
- Testing: Jest with proper British spelling in describe blocks

### Phase 2: Team Standards
Merge personal preferences into team standards:
- Agree on the non-negotiables
- Allow flexibility where it doesn't matter
- Stop having those pointless style arguments in PRs

### Phase 3: AI Integration
Train your AI assistant on your patterns:
- Feed it your best code
- Correct it when it deviates
- Watch it learn and adapt

## The Revolution Is Personal

This isn't about right or wrong. There's no single "correct" way to write code.

It's about:
- **Ownership**: Your code should feel like yours
- **Efficiency**: Stop wasting time on reformatting
- **Joy**: Actually enjoying the code you work with
- **Pride**: Being proud of every line, even the AI-generated ones

## What's Next

The future of AI coding as I see it:
1. **Personal style profiles** (your coding fingerprint)
2. **Team style consensus** (collaborative standards)
3. **Project-specific adaptations** (context-aware generation)
4. **Evolution with your growth** (the AI learns as you level up)

## The Bottom Line

Code is personal. Style is identity. AI should respect both.

When AI learns to code in your style, something remarkable happens. The friction disappears. The cognitive load drops. The joy returns. You stop being a code editor and become a creator again.

This isn't about making AI more powerful. It's about making AI more personal. About building tools that adapt to us, rather than forcing us to adapt to them. About respecting the craft and the craftsperson.

Your style isn't wrong. It's yours. And that matters more than any style guide or linting rule ever could.

The revolution isn't in the technology. It's in recognising that every developer deserves tools that understand them. That learn from them. That grow with them.

That's the future I'm building. One personal style profile at a time.
