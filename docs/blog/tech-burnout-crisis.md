# The Tech Burnout Crisis: When Tools Become Torment

## The Exhaustion Epidemic

Developers are burning out faster than ever.
The tools meant to help are making it worse.

## The Acceleration Trap

AI was supposed to reduce workload.
Instead, it increased expectations:
- Ship 10x faster
- Build 10x more
- Never stop, AI doesn't sleep

## The Context Switching Hell

Every day:
- 10 different tools
- 50 context switches
- 100 explanations to AI
- Zero deep work

## The Dehumanization Factor

Treated like machines:
- Always available
- Instantly productive
- Emotionally neutral
- Infinitely scalable

We're not machines.

## The Solution

### Human-Centered Development
- Sustainable pace
- Deep work blocks
- Context persistence
- Meaningful progress

### AI That Helps, Not Hurries
- Reduces repetition
- Maintains context
- Respects human limits
- Enhances, not replaces

*Technology should reduce burnout, not cause it.*
