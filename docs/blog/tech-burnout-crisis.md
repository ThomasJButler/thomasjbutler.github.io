# The Tech Burnout Crisis: When Tools Become Torment

## The Exhaustion Epidemic

Developers are burning out faster than ever.
The tools meant to help are making it worse.

And I'm seeing it everywhere - from London startups to Manchester agencies. We're all knackered.

## The Acceleration Trap

AI was supposed to reduce workload.
Instead, it increased expectations:
- Ship 10x faster (with the same deadlines)
- Build 10x more (with the same team)
- Never stop, AI doesn't sleep (but we do)

Last week, a PM actually said: "With AI, this should only take an hour, right?" 
It was a week's worth of work. AI or not.

## The Context Switching Hell

My typical day:
- 10 different tools (each with their own login)
- 50 context switches (goodbye, flow state)
- 100 explanations to AI (same project, every time)
- Zero deep work (when does the actual coding happen?)

It's like being a juggler who keeps getting handed more balls. Eventually, they all drop.

## The Dehumanisation Factor

We're being treated like machines:
- Always available (Slack at midnight? Really?)
- Instantly productive (no warm-up time allowed)
- Emotionally neutral (burnout? That's a you problem)
- Infinitely scalable (just use AI to do more!)

But here's the thing: We're not machines. We're humans. We need tea breaks, we have bad days, we get tired.

## The UK Reality

The British tech scene has its own flavour of burnout:
- Pretending everything's "fine" when it's not
- Working through lunch because "that's what everyone does"
- Staying late but calling it "just finishing up"
- Never using all our holiday days

We're politely working ourselves into the ground.

## The Solution

### Human-Centred Development
What actually works:
- **Sustainable pace**: Marathon, not sprint
- **Deep work blocks**: Actual coding time, imagine that
- **Context persistence**: Stop explaining the same things
- **Meaningful progress**: Quality over quantity

### AI That Helps, Not Hurries
AI should:
- Reduce repetition (not add to expectations)
- Maintain context (remember yesterday's work)
- Respect human limits (we're not robots)
- Enhance, not replace (augment, don't automate everything)

## My Approach

Here's how I'm fighting burnout in my team:

### Boundaries
- No Slack after 6pm
- No weekend deployments
- No "quick questions" during deep work
- No shame in taking breaks

### Realistic Expectations
- AI saves time, it doesn't multiply humans
- Faster tools don't mean shorter deadlines
- More output doesn't mean better output
- Developers need thinking time, not just typing time

### Actual Self-Care
Not the corporate wellness nonsense:
- Take proper lunch breaks (away from the desk)
- Use all holiday days (they're not optional)
- Say no to unrealistic deadlines (politely but firmly)
- Close the laptop at a reasonable hour (work will be there tomorrow)

## The Bottom Line

Technology should reduce burnout, not cause it.

If your tools are making you miserable, they're not tools - they're torment.

We need to stop accepting burnout as "just part of tech". It's not. It's a choice we're making, and we can choose differently.

Start small:
- Close Slack at 5pm today
- Take a proper lunch tomorrow
- Say no to one unrealistic request this week
- Remember: You're a human, not a machine

Your mental health is more important than any sprint goal.
