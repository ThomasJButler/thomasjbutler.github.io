# The Tech Burnout Crisis

Developers around the world are burning out faster than ever.
The tools meant to help us, are making it worse.

And I'm seeing it everywhere. From London startups to Manchester agencies. 

Everyone is exhausted.

## The Acceleration Trap

AI was supposed to reduce workload.
Instead, it increased expectations:
- Ship that release 10x faster (with the same deadlines)
- Build 10x more (with the same team, or even less staff..)
- Never stop, as AI doesn't sleep (but we do)

## Context Switching Hell

A typical day in a web agency nowadays:
- 10 different tools (each with their own login)
- 50 context switches (goodbye, flow state)
- 100 explanations to AI (same project, every time)
- Zero deep work (when does the actual coding happen?)

It's like being a juggler who keeps getting handed more balls. 

Eventually, they all drop.

## The Dehumanisation Factor

We're being treated like machines:
- Always available (Slack at midnight? Really?)
- Instantly productive (no warm-up time allowed)
- Emotionally neutral (burnout? That's a you problem friend)
- Infinitely scalable (just use AI to do more)

But here's the thing: We're not machines. 
We're humans. We need tea breaks, we need to eat, we have bad days, we get tired and have to sleep.

I have heard stories of devs replaced by AI, only to be hired back somewhere else to fix AI spaghetti code. 

The problem is obvious, enhance your team members with AI, and keep output the same, the output will better and staff are happier. It's a win win.  

For big tech companies, their assets are their liability, large datacenters and subsidising AI costs to gain market share and exposure. It is not magic, and the hype really is not what it seems, it's manufactured. 

AI is just a tool to enhance human output (and a large segment of Machine Learning). 
That is it. It can't do it alone. We as humans, shouldn't even want an AI that can do it all alone.

## The UK Reality

In England, the tech scene has its own flavour of burnout:
- Pretending everything's "fine" when it's not
- Working through lunch because "that's what everyone does"
- Staying late but calling it "just finishing up"
- Never using all our holiday days

We're politely working ourselves into the ground.

## The Solution

### Human-Centred Development
What actually works:
- **Sustainable pace**: Marathon, not sprint
- **Deep work blocks**: Actual coding time
- **Context persistence**: Stop explaining the same things. I have a few other blogs on context engineering. 
- **Meaningful progress**: AI enhanced quality over quantity

AI should:
- Reduce repetition (not add to expectations)
- Maintain context (remember yesterday's work)
- Respect human limits (we're not robots)
- Enhance, not replace (augment, don't automate everything)

## My Approach

Here's how I'm fighting burnout:

### Boundaries
- No Slack after 6pm
- No weekend deployments
- No "quick questions" during deep work
- No shame in taking breaks (important)

### Realistic Expectations
- AI saves time, it doesn't multiply humans
- Faster tools don't mean shorter deadlines
- More output doesn't mean better output
- Developers need thinking time, not just typing time

### Actual Self-Care
Not the corporate wellness nonsense:
- Take proper lunch breaks (away from the desk)
- Use all holiday days (they're not optional)
- Say no to unrealistic deadlines (politely but firmly)
- Close the laptop at a reasonable hour (work will be there tomorrow)

### Result? 
- Ironically, better work, a clearer mind, and more enjoyment in life.

## Choose Sustainability

Technology should reduce burnout, not cause it. If your tools are making you miserable, they're not tools. They're torment.

Stop accepting burnout as "just part of tech". It's not. It's a choice we're making, and we can choose differently.

Start small today:
- Close Slack at 5pm
- Take a proper lunch tomorrow
- Say no to one unrealistic request this week
- Remember: You're a human, not a machine

Burnout isn't inevitable. It's the result of systems that don't respect human limitations. 

When we can now build tools that remember context, we reduce cognitive load. 
When we set realistic expectations, we reduce stress. 
When we respect boundaries, we create sustainability.

Your wellbeing matters more than any deadline, any feature, any metric. 
Take care of yourself. The code will still be there tomorrow.
