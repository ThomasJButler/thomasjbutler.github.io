# The Personalisation Revolution

**Published:** 15/10/2025

## The Age of Generic AI Is Ending

Every AI interaction feels the same:
Every ChatGPT conversation: Same robotic personality
Every Copilot suggestion: Same vanilla style
Every AI response: Same soulless voice

I'm done with it. The age of one size fits all AI is over.

## The Personal AI Future

Picture this:
- Your AI writes like you (not like some Silicon Valley bot)
- Talks how you prefer (British English, thank you)
- Remembers what you need (not what it thinks you need)
- Grows with you (learns your quirks over time)

This isn't just customisation. This is personalisation.

## The Transformation

### Today: You Adapt to AI
Look at what we're doing now. It's backwards:
- Learning its weird American quirks
- Working around its limitations (why can't it remember anything?)
- Accepting its bland style
- Conforming to its robotic patterns

I used to spend a lot of my time translating AI speak into something that sounds human.

### Tomorrow: AI Adapts to You
Here's how it should work!
- Learns your quirks (snake_case forever)
- Works with your flow (night owl? It adapts)
- Matches your style (no more camelCase)
- Follows your patterns (early returns, minimal comments)

## Building A Personal AI

I've been working on this, and here's what I've learned:

### Layer 1: Syntax
Your formatting, your conventions. If you like tabs, it uses tabs. 
If you're team spaces, it uses spaces.

### Layer 2: Voice
How you communicate. I don't want my AI sounding like a corporate drone. 
I want it to sound like me after three coffees at 2am. Coherent but casual.

### Layer 3: Memory
What it remembers. Not everything needs remembering, but the important bits? Absolutely. 

That bug you fixed last month? The pattern you always use for error handling? That would eradicate most issues developers have while using AI. It doesn't have any past knoweldge of the codebase, it can check but it has no experience of helping to fix it.

### Layer 4: Growth
Evolution over time. As you get better, it gets better. As you change your style, it adapts. It's not static. It's alive. (..and never sentient!)

## Example

Here's what I'm building:

```javascript
// AI config (work in progress)
const myAI = {
  syntax: {
    naming: 'snake_case',  // Because I'm not American
    quotes: 'single',      // Double quotes are for JSON only
    semicolons: false,     // ASI works fine
    indent: 2              // The only correct choice
  },
  voice: {
    formality: 'casual',   // No corporate speak
    humour: 'british',     // Dry, sarcastic, perfect
    swearing: 'mild',      // Sometimes you need it
    locality: 'liverpool'  // Scouse phrases welcome
  },
  memory: {                // Currently, memory is a set of .md files that update
    projectContext: true,  // With each iteration 
    personalPatterns: true,
    teamConventions: true,
    pastMistakes: true     // Learn from my mistakes
  }
}
```

## Real Impact

This isn't theoretical. I've tested this:

**Before personalisation:**
- 30 minutes writing code
- 30 minutes reformatting AI suggestions
- 15 minutes fixing Americanisms
- 10 minutes adding personality
- 30 minute review

**After personalisation:**
- 30 minutes writing code
- 15 minutes reviewing (usually less, but no reformatting means I am in no rush)
- Done

That's over an hour saved per session. Multiply that by every developer, every day.

## The Revolution Is Personal

This revolution isn't about making AI smarter.
It's about making AI more personal.
It's about AI that feels like an extension of you, not a foreign entity.

Think about it. We personalise everything:
- Our IDEs (dark theme, obviously)
- Our keyboards (mechanical or nothing)
- Our desk setup (standing desk gang)
- Our coffee (oat milk flat white, thanks)

Why not our AI?

## What's Blocking Us?

### Technical Challenges
- Storage (context is expensive)
- Processing (personalisation needs compute)
- Privacy (your style is your data)

### Cultural Resistance
- "One size fits all" mentality
- Fear of fragmentation
- Corporate standardisation obsession

### Economic Factors
- Cheaper to build generic
- Easier to maintain one model
- Less support complexity

But here's the thing. These are all solvable. We just need to want it enough.

## The Call to Arms

I'm building this with or without the big tech companies. Creating personal AI that actually feels personal. Not customised. Personalised. 

There's a difference.

If you're tired of:
- Reformatting AI code
- Translating American to British
- Fighting with generic suggestions
- Feeling like you're adapting to the machine

Join the revolution.

Your code style isn't wrong. Your preferences aren't weird. Your patterns aren't bad. They're yours. And your AI should respect that.

The future isn't one AI for everyone. It's one AI for each of us. Unique, personal, adapted.

That's not just better technology. That's technology that respects humanity.
