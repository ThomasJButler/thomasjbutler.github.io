Ctrl+S the World: A Hacker's Odyssey
Version 1.3

Welcome to "Ctrl+S the World: A Hacker's Odyssey"

An innovative, text-based Python game that combines wit, humour, and a touch of the absurd to embark on a quest unlike any other. 
Join Aver-Ag Engi Neer and a band of eccentric tech legends as they navigate the perils of a technology-driven apocalypse, with nothing but their coding skills, a series of dubious ethical decisions, and you, the player, guiding them through.
