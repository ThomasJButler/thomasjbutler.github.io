# From Prompts to Context Systems: The Next Evolution

**Published:** 26/06/2025

## The Prompt Engineering Era

2023: "Master prompt engineering!"
2024: "Advanced prompting techniques!"
2025: "Hang on, why are we still doing this?"

It's like we discovered fire and then spent years perfecting how to rub sticks together instead of inventing matches.

## The Fundamental Flaw

Prompt engineering is like:
- Programming without variables (imagine that nightmare)
- Cooking without saving recipes (Groundhog Day in the kitchen)
- Building without blueprints (cowboy coding at its finest)

Every single time, starting from scratch.

## The Evolution

### Generation 1: Basic Prompts
```
"Write a function"
# AI: *writes random function that adds two numbers*
# You: Not what I meant...
```

### Generation 2: Detailed Prompts
```
"Write a Python function that validates email addresses using regex"
# AI: *at least it's Python now*
```

### Generation 3: Mega Prompts (Current Hell)
```
"You are an expert Python developer with 10 years experience.
Write a function that validates email addresses using regex.
Follow PEP 8, add type hints, include docstrings, handle edge
cases including null values and international domains, write
unit tests using pytest, ensure it's compatible with Python 3.8+..."

# 500 tokens just to get started. Every. Single. Time.
```

### Generation 4: A Context Systems (The Future)
```
"Validate email"
# System already knows I'm a Python dev from Liverpool who
# likes snake_case, pytest, and proper error handling
```

## Why Prompts Are Primitive

Here's the truth nobody wants to admit:

Prompts are:
- **Stateless**: Goldfish memory
- **Repetitive**: Copy-pasting your life story every time
- **Fragile**: Forget one word and it all breaks
- **Inefficient**: 90% context, 10% actual request, dependent on model power.

Context systems are:
- **Stateful**: Actually remembers who you are
- **Efficient**: Context loaded once, used forever
- **Robust**: Understanding persists through typos
- **Minimal**: Just say what you need

## The Context Advantage

### Token Efficiency
```
Prompt approach: 500 tokens per request
Context approach: 50 tokens per request
90% reduction

That's real money saved. And sanity.
```

### Consistency
```
Prompts: Different output every time (chaos)
Context: Same understanding always (bliss)
```

### Evolution
```
Prompts: Day 1 forever
Context: Actually learns and grows
```

## Building Context Systems

Here's what I'm working on:

### Intelligent Context (The Dream)
```yaml
context:
  understands:
    - Your architecture decisions
    - Why you hate that one library
    - When you need encouragement vs efficiency
  predicts:
    - What you'll ask next
    - Where bugs might hide
    - When you need a break
  remembers:
    - That authentication system from last month
    - Your preferred error handling
    - That time the regex actually worked first try
    - Each conversation, updating the context documents before each commit.
```

## The Paradigm Shift

We're moving from:
- Asking "How?" to saying "What"
- Explaining everything to assuming understanding
- Repetition to evolution
- Strangers to partners

It's like the difference between training a new junior dev every day versus working with your trusted colleague who knows exactly what you mean when you say "do the usual thing".

## My Real World Impact

Since implementing a context systems:
- 60% less typing
- 60% fewer misunderstandings
- 100% less copy-pasting the same context
- Actually enjoyable to use

## No More Prompts

Stop optimising prompts. Seriously, stop. 

Start building context!

The future isn't better prompts. It's no prompts. 

Just conversation with something that actually knows you.

Imagine: "Fix that bug from yesterday" and it knows exactly what you mean. That's what I'm building.

When your AI remembers who you are, what you've built, and how you work, something fundamental shifts. You stop being a prompter and become a developer again. Focusing on the creative aspects, and using AI for the non creative tasks.
