## Your Code is Your Signature

It's your coding DNA. And current AI? It completely ignores it.

AI generates "correct" code that somehow looks wrong.

Every developer knows this, but few talk about it. We all have our own coding style, e.g;
- How you name variables.
- How you structure functions.
- How you handle errors.
- How you write comments.

## The AI Reformation Ritual

This pattern is becoming more common with AI powered IDEs:
1. AI generates code
2. You spend time reformatting everything
3. You rename all the variables
4. You restructure the logic to match how your brain works
5. You fix the style to not look like a robot wrote it

Why are we accepting this?

It's like having a brilliant assistant who speaks a different dialect. Technically correct, but it's in not your own style.

## Enter Style DNA - Teach Once, Apply Forever

A way to describe your personal coding style once and have AI not just remember it, but stick to it.

### Provide Real Examples

You show it what your actual code looks like.. how you structure logic, name things, handle errors.

Here's my personal Python style:

```python
from typing import Optional, Dict

class user_manager:
    def __init__(self):
        # store users in memory for now
        # class name is lowercase (could use pascalcase if i ever change my mind)
        self._users: Dict[int, str] = {}  # private member via underscore prefix

    def add_user(self, user_id: int, name: str) -> None:
        # adds or replaces a user name, simple as that
        self._users[user_id] = name

    def get_user(self, user_id: int) -> Optional[str]:
        # return the user name if found, none otherwise
        return self._users.get(user_id)

    def greet_user(self, user_id: int) -> str:
        # early check if the user doesn't exist
        name = self.get_user(user_id)
        if not name:
            return f"user {user_id} not found"
        # short and clear: greet politely
        return f"hello, {name}"  # type hints on public methods
```

### AI Will Learn YOUR Style

Now every generation matches:
- Your naming (snake_case, kebab-case, whatever works for you)
- Your structure (flat is better than nested)
- Your patterns (DRY but not obsessively)
- Your preferences (tabs vs spaces aside)

## Technical Implementation

**Style Extraction** - Analyse your existing codebase to detect patterns in naming, structure, formatting, and recurring logic.

**Style Injection** - Every new generation applies those learned preferences automatically.

**Style Evolution** - When you edit the AI's output, it notices the differences and learns from them, continuously refining your profile.

The impact? It has improved my efficiency using AI tools by 200% (on average).

### Before
- Generate: 30 seconds
- Reformat: 5 minutes
- Total: 5:30 minutes

### After
- Generate: 30 seconds
- Review: 30 seconds
- Total: 1 minute

## High Level Impact

- **Consistency**: Your entire codebase looks like one person wrote it.
- **Speed**: No more reformatting means shipping faster.
- **Sanity**: Less cognitive load switching between AI style and your style.
- **Team Harmony**: Everyone codes their way, git diffs show what matters.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 - Personal Profiles
- Functions: snake_case
- Variables: descriptive_names_over_brevity
- Comments: Only when the why isn't obvious, UK English
- Testing: Jest

### Phase 2 - Team Standards
- Agree on the non-negotiables
- Allow flexibility where it doesn't matter

### Phase 3: AI Integration
- Feed it your best code
- Correct it to your style when it deviates
- Watch it learn and adapt

## The Revolution Is Personal

This isn't about right or wrong.

There's no single "correct" way to write code.

**Your Style Matters.** Code is personal. Style is identity. AI should respect both!

The revolution isn't in the technology. It's in recognising that every developer deserves tools that understand them. That learn from them. That grow with them.

It's all about:
- **Ownership**: Your code should feel like yours
- **Efficiency**: Stop wasting time on reformatting
- **Joy**: Actually enjoying the code you work with
- **Pride**: Being proud of every line, even the AI-generated ones

When AI learns to code in your style, something remarkable happens.

The friction disappears. The cognitive load drops. The joy returns.

You stop being a code editor and become a creator again.

This isn't about making AI more powerful. It's about making AI more personal.

About building tools that adapt to us, rather than forcing us to adapt to them.

**Your style isn't wrong. It's yours.**
