5. **Video Banner**
   - Initially implemented as full-screen hero

6. **Vite Setup Started**
   - Installed Vite, @vitejs/plugin-legacy, and terser
   - Created vite.config.js with multi-page setup
   - Ready for next phase of implementation

## 🔄 In Progress:

### Vite Build System Implementation`/
**Next Steps:**
1. Update package.json scripts:
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview",
  "clean": "rm -rf dist",
  "lint": "eslint src/**/*.js",
  "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.{js,css,html}\""
}
```

2. Convert script imports to ES modules in HTML files
3. Create main entry file for each HTML page
4. Test development server

### Replace Media Queries with Intrinsic Layouts
- Already converted navigation and grid layouts
- Still need to update remaining media queries in global.css

## 📋 Remaining Todo Items:

### High Priority:
- Complete Vite setup and test build process
- Configure TypeScript and ESLint
- Create component architecture (React recommended)
- Configure GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

### Medium Priority:
- Implement WebGL Matrix rain with Three.js
- Set up visual regression testing
- Optimize images with WebP/AVIF
- Implement lazy loading
- Add Lighthouse CI
- Implement container queries
- Create utility CSS classes
- Document in CHANGELOG.md

### Low Priority:
- PWA manifest and service worker
- Advanced Matrix shaders
- Storybook documentation
- Web Audio API integration

## 🎯 Next Session Focus:

1. **Complete Vite Setup:**
   - Update all HTML files to use ES modules
   - Create entry points
   - Test dev server
   - Verify production build

2. **TypeScript Migration:**
   - Install TypeScript dependencies
   - Create tsconfig.json
   - Convert scripts.js to scripts.ts
   - Add type definitions

3. **Component Architecture:**
   - Decide on React vs Vue (React recommended for ecosystem)
   - Set up component structure
   - Migrate sections to components

## 💡 Important Notes:

- Video banner was removed by user from index.html
- CSS custom properties are fully implemented
- Gallery sections are working with smooth scrolling
- Project uses GSAP and ScrollMagic (need to maintain compatibility)
- Matrix theme should be preserved throughout modernization

## 🚨 Critical Path:

1. Finish Vite setup → 2. Add TypeScript → 3. Component architecture → 4. CI/CD pipeline

This will give you a modern, maintainable foundation for future enhancements.
