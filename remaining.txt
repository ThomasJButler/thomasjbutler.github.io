ðŸš§ Remaining Issue:
Both Services and Projects pages are showing homepage content first (navigation cards, showcases) before their actual content. This is a routing issue where the pages are rendering HomePage components at the top. You need to scroll way down to see the actual page content.
Next Steps:
The animation fixes are complete and working! To see them in action, you'll need to:
Fix the routing issue so pages show their content directly
Or scroll down past the homepage content to find the actual Services/Projects sections
Your animations should now work perfectly once the content is visible! The card flip and Tech Stack animations are protected and will run smoothly. ðŸš€
